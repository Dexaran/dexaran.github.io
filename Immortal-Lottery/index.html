            <p class="fs-5">The crypto industry is developing very quickly. This is one of the most advanced and newest areas of human knowledge, and therefore everything that you knew a year ago can be hopelessly out of date.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5">However, the "research" term is usually negatively perceived by the community. In our industry researching is often used as an excuse for the lack of activity. "Why are there no news? - We were busy researching"</p>
            <p class="fs-5">Now it's time to introduce a new type of application that can serve as generalised benchmarking tool for every investigated smart-contract development platform as well as provide a living proof of the research being done.</p>

          <p class="fs-5">The application was selected based on the following criteria:
            <ul class="fs-5">
              <li>It should be viable. Nobody cares about "hello world" programs when dealing with smart-contracts because blockchains are about money and business logic.</li>
              <li>It should be "immortal." The application must independently function requiring zero interference from the creators side.</li>
              <li>It must It must be complex enough. The DAPP must challenge critical parts of the development platform and expose its bottlenecks and shortcomings.</li>

            So far, the Telegram lottery bot has proven to be one of the most usable tools in the ecosystem that users keep interacting with. As the result, it was decided to implement a similar on-chain application.

          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">The lottery allows users to deposit CLO to the contract. Users funds are added to the "prize pool". Each user has a chance to win the total prize pool (with a %fee subtracted) which depends on the users deposit size compared to deposits of other users.</p>
          <p class="fs-5">The %fee goes to the additional staking pool. It is redistributed between token stakers proportional to their shares.</p>
